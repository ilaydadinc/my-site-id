The study aims to understand the changes in Snowshoe hare(Lepus americanus) density and physical characteristics of Snowshoe hares in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in Alaska between years 1998-2012. Capture-recapture studies of snowshoe hares at 5 different locations showed that snowshoe hare densities has been declining since 1999[1]. This project analyzes the survival of snowshow hares by looking at the changes in physical characteristics of Snowshoe hares over time.

**Figure 2: Snowshoe Hare Body Condition over the years (1998-2012).** Body Weight/ Hindfoot Length is used as the Body Condition Index based on the previous research stating that body condition is strongly correlated to mass and hind foot length, and the index is robust to age and sex differences [2] The bars represent the yearly mean Body Condition Indices of both adult and juvenile snowshoe hares from both sex. Error bars indicate ± 1 standard deviation. The Body Condition Indices showed an overall decreasing trend over the years. The error bars show that variance of Body Condition Indices within the population are getting smaller. *Data used with permission from The Bonanza Creek LTER.*

Over the years, snowshow hare population density has been decreasing. Studies has been conducted to see if this is related to the physical conditions of snowshow hares. The graph in Figure 2 shows there is a general decreasing trend in the body conditions of snowshow hares in Bonanza Creek. Also, there is less variance in the body conditions withing the survivor population.
