abstract: Greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector comprise roughly 30% of global anthropogenic emissions (including land use change and fertilizer emissions). Current agricultural practices also contribute to dramatic declines in soil productivity and increases in soil erosion rates. Regenerative organic agriculture has been pioneered by many as a solution to these problems. Regenerative agriculture builds upon the USDA organic certification, requiring additional practices such as cover cropping, crop rotations, reduced or no-till, rotational grazing, and the use of compost or manure as fertilizer. These practices theoretically allow crops to pull more carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the soil, thereby mitigating climate change while improving soil health. Patagonia Inc. is interested in moving from organic to regenerative organic agriculture in the production of their fiber and food crops. Patagonia has commissioned this team to examine if regenerative organic practices for crops in their supply chain actually has increased carbon sequestration and soil health benefits over their current organic production. The team used the Denitrification-Decomposition Model (DNDC) to simulate soil organic carbon changes and net greenhouse gas emissions between organic and regenerative production of cotton, kernza wheat, mangoes, and perennial grasses for bison grazing. The team found regenerative organic practices were successful in building soil organic carbon compared to organic practices for all four crops. However, the results of the net greenhouse gas emission analysis was much more variable depending on crop type, soil properties, and climate.
